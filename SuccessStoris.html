        <p>
            In the West Bank, 1998, founded by a <b>Palestinian</b> family from Ramallah, Abu Ammar Coffee started as a
            small café offering traditional Arabic coffee and some local pastries. The idea was to create a space that
            brought the local community together and celebrated <b>Palestinian</b> heritage through coffee and food.
        </p>
        <p>
            In its early days, Abu Ammar Coffee faced many challenges, particularly due to the difficult political and
            economic conditions in the region. The security situation affected the flow of customers, making it
            difficult to maintain the café's operations. Instead of giving in to these challenges, the family focused on
            providing a unique experience for their customers. They expanded the menu to include traditional dishes like
            falafel, hummus, and kibbeh, which helped attract more people. They also organized cultural and musical
            events and added a variety of specialty coffees, further enhancing the café’s appeal. The café's location,
            with its warm and inviting atmosphere, played a significant role in improving the quality of the coffee and
            contributed to making it a cultural center, rather than just a café.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, Abu Ammar Coffee began attracting customers from different regions. It gained a reputation for
            its high-quality coffee and distinctive flavors, and successfully built a large and loyal customer base. The
            owners expanded the café and opened new branches in other cities, which helped to further strengthen the
            brand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, Abu Ammar Coffee is one of the most popular cafés in Palestine. It has gained widespread fame for the
            quality of its beverages and food, in addition to the warm and comfortable atmosphere it provides. The café
            is also committed to working with local farmers to offer fresh, organic ingredients. Our location is not
            just about coffee; it's about enjoying an experience that is crafted by <b>Palestinian</b> hands, with every
            cup and every dish telling the story of our culture and heritage.

        <p>
            Hala Saleem, the Lebanese entrepreneur, has had a deep passion for coffee since she was young, always in
            search of a new and unique flavor for her favorite drink. Amid the challenging circumstances following
            Lebanon's economic crisis, Hala faced significant hurdles, including unemployment and a lack of
            opportunities. However, she decided to find a way to combine her love for coffee with an innovative idea to
            carve a path forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hala came up with the idea of blending coffee with za'atar, a popular ingredient in Lebanese cuisine that
            adds a distinctive flavor to many dishes. She began experimenting at home, using simple ingredients and
            recipes of her own creation. However, her initial attempts did not turn out as expected, as she struggled to
            find the right balance of flavors. Despite the setbacks, she did not give up and kept refining her approach
            until she successfully developed the perfect blend.
        </p>
        <p><u>
                During her experiments, Hala discovered an app called <b>"Coffee Academy,"</b> which provided valuable
                tips on improving coffee flavor and refining her blends. The app helped her hone her roasting skills and
                innovate further, contributing to the improvement of her final product.
            </u></p>
        <p>
            Once Hala perfected her coffee-za'atar blend, she decided to turn her passion into a business. However, the
            road was not easy. She faced difficulties in finding an affordable location and securing the necessary
            materials due to the ongoing economic crisis. Despite these challenges, she opened the first branch of
            "Za'atar Coffee" in a modest neighborhood in Beirut.
        </p>

        <div class="header-box">Qahwa Nuzul</div>
        <p>
            "Qahwa Nuzul" was founded in 2006 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by a group of young Saudis who had a deep passion
            for coffee and saw it as an opportunity to achieve their dream. They didn’t have a large capital or huge
            investments, but they relied on their love for the product and their desire to offer a unique coffee
            experience to the people of Saudi Arabia.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first challenge they faced was finding a suitable location to showcase their products. At the time, the
            local market was saturated with large Western coffee chains like Starbucks and Café Coffee Day. However,
            they didn’t let that stop them. They started with a small café in a popular neighborhood, offering
            high-quality coffee with an authentic Arabic touch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, "Qahwa Nuzul" gained popularity among Saudis, who felt a sense of connection with the brand’s
            identity. The cafés started spreading to different cities in the kingdom, but they continued to face various
            challenges, such as managing quality across all branches and ensuring smooth operational processes. They
            focused on training staff and providing the best possible service. This became a key factor in their
            success, as they realized that coffee wasn’t just a drink; it was a social experience.
